# Sorting_Algorithm_Visualizer

This project is a visualization of major sorting algorithms. It shows the step-by-step sorting of arbitrarily ordered arrays by representing integers as rectangles with varying heights. 

The goal of the project is to practice algorithmic skills developed over my first year at Northeastern and in my second year CS3000 - Algorithms and Data course.

It is currently a work in progress.
